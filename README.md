# 3_Cloud_Data_Warehouse

This repository contains all the files for the Cloud Data Warehouse project of the Data Engineer Nanodegree Program by Udacity.

## Introduction
"A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, you are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights into what songs their users are listening to. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results."

## Installation
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the dependecies (it is recommended to create a virtual environment before doing that).

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
